# Experiments

This directory contains isolated Jupyter notebooks for exploratory work.

**Rule:** No production code lives here. Notebooks are for:
- Debugging and understanding model behavior
- Comparing scoring configurations
- Visualizing embedding spaces
- Validating bias analysis logic on synthetic data

See `app/services/` for all production ML logic.
